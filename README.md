# Lab case-study Scenario
A new Security Engineer at Huge Logistics company, you're tasked with reviewing the IAM (Identity and Access Management) policy attached to an IAM user in a specific AWS (Amazon Web Services) account. It was observed that the IAM user's custom policy granted excessive permissions. The manager requested that the company security team analyze the policy to understand how a malicious actor, including an employee, could exploit it. You need to identify misconfigurations and excessive permissions and assess the possibility of privilege escalation.
